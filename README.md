## Overview
Domain:  Tourism | Function: Revenue / Municipal Administration

Telangana is one of Indiaâ€™s leading states and has published its tourism data under its open data policy. As a data analyst, I saw this as an opportunity to expand my skills and show my work on a bigger scale. My idea is to find the patterns in the given data, do additional research, and give data-informed recommendations to the Telangana government which can be used to increase their revenue by improving administrative operations.

The Telangana Tourism Dashboard provides a comprehensive view of the tourism industry in Telangana, with a focus on Hyderabad. It identifies the top & bottom-performing districts based on CAGR and highlights the peak & low-performing months. It also includes projections for the number of tourists and revenue generated by the tourism industry.
